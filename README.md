# Stanford CS231n Assignments

This repository contains my solutions to the assignments for the Stanford CS231n course on Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition.

## Assignments

- Assignment 1 : Image Classification, kNN, SVM, Softmax, Fully-Connected Neural Network
- Assignment 2 : Fully-Connected Nets, Batch Normalization, Dropout, Convolutional Nets, Network Visualization
- Assignment 3 : Image Captioning with Vanilla RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers, Generative Adversarial Networks

Each assignment is designed to help reinforce the concepts taught in the course and provide hands-on experience in implementing various components of deep learning models.

## Getting Started

To get started with the assignments, follow the instructions provided in each assignment's respective folder. You will find detailed instructions, starter code, and any necessary datasets or resources.

Please note that these assignments are part of the Stanford CS231n course and are meant for educational purposes. Make sure to adhere to the course's honor code and guidelines when completing the assignments.
